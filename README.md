# Graph Algorithms
A collection of some graph algorithms I wrote during my free time  
They all contain pretty in-deaph comments, so feel free to use as refrence  
Some of these were homework for my [ALGO2](https://github.com/Team-ALGO2/ALGO2) Class  

## Algorithms:
- Advanced Pathfinding Algorithms
  - Dijkstra’s algorithm (Default)
  - Bellman-Ford’s algorithm (Working-ish)

- All Pairs Shortest Path Algorithms
  - Floyd-Warshall’s algorithm (Default) (Working-ish)

- Advanced Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms
  - Prim’s algorithm (Default) (Working-ish)
  - Kruskal’s algorithm (**TODO**)
  
- Maximum Flow Algorithms
  - Ford-Fulkerson algorithm (Default) (**TODO**)
  - Dinic's algorithm (**TODO**)

> Note: Some of these were made before learning `malloc`, rewrite incoming!
