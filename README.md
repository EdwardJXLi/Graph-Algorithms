# Graph Algorithms
A collection of some graph algorithms I wrote during my free time  
They all contain pretty in-deaph comments, so feel free to use as refrence  
Some of these were homework for my [ALGO2](https://github.com/Team-ALGO2/ALGO2) Class  

## Algorithms:
- **Advanced Pathfinding Algorithms**
  - **Dijkstra’s algorithm (Done!)**
    - Used to find smallest path from one node to any other node with non-negative weigth on vertices. Some examples of its usage could be google maps to find shortest route.
  - **Bellman-Ford’s algorithm (Done!)**
    - Similar to Dikjtra, but it can handle negative weigths. In return, it detect nagative cycles.  

- **All Pairs Shortest Path Algorithms**
  - **Floyd-Warshall’s algorithm (Done!)**
    - Used to find shortest path from all nodes to all other nodes (All Pair Shortest Paths (APSP))

- **Advanced Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms**
  - **Kruskal’s algorithm** (**__TODO__**)
    - Used to find minimun spanning tree (MST). It calculates shortest route that passes througth all nodes.
  - **Prim’s algorithm (Done!)**
    - Used to find minimun spanning tree (MST), similar to Kruskals. Major difference is Prim scans by nodes, while Kruskals scans by verticies.
  
- **Maximum Flow Algorithms**
  - **Ford-Fulkerson algorithm** (**__TODO__**)
    - Description TODO
  - **Dinic's algorithm** (**__TODO__**)
    - Description TODO
